# Linear Models for Handwritten Digits Classification

Implementation of binary logistic regression and multi-class logisitc regression models on a partial dataset from MNIST (training and test data provided).

### Specifications
The model will take a 16 × 16 image of handwritten digits as inputs and classify the image into different classes.

For each data sample, the dictionary key ‘x’ indicates its raw features, which are represented by a 256-dimensional vector where the values between [−1,1] indicate grayscale pixel values for a 16 ×16 image. In addition, the key ’y’ is the label for a data example, which can be 0, 1, or 2.

#### Binary case
- Classes are 1 and 2.

#### Multi-class case
- Classes are 0, 1, and 2.
